<h3 class="setlist-header"><strong>Set 1:</strong>  <span class="jam-entry jam-tooltip jam-link" data-tooltip="<strong>Timing:</strong> 16:06<br><strong>Notes:</strong> Mostly standard, but goes double time for a minute or so towards the end. 
" data-url="/jam-chart/?filter=Funkadelic">Funkadelic</span> (16) > All My Friends (2) -> <span class="jam-entry jam-tooltip jam-link" data-tooltip="<strong>Timing:</strong> 22:32<br><strong>Notes:</strong> Lethargic through much of the first half, but swirls into a Miami nightclub around 9:00, peaks soulfully with a twinkling comedown, and has a feel-good roots rock build -&gt; Mind&#x27;s Unchained.
" data-url="/jam-chart/?filter=Bee Jam">Bee Jam</span> (22) -> Mind's Unchained (21), <span class="jam-entry jam-tooltip jam-link" data-tooltip="<strong>Timing:</strong> 14:24<br><strong>Notes:</strong> An entrancing Latin jazz rave that slides into a concentrated groove that Cory dances over with several keyboards before settling on the grand piano. 
" data-url="/jam-chart/?filter=America">America</span> (14), <span class="jam-entry jam-tooltip jam-link" data-tooltip="<strong>Timing:</strong> 16:17<br><strong>Notes:</strong> Starts out slow and funky, with some sample manipulation from Cory before going breakbeat. Gets spacey in the middle.

<h3 class="setlist-header"><strong>Encore:</strong>  <span class="jam-entry jam-tooltip jam-link" data-tooltip="<strong>Timing:</strong> 14:03<br><strong>Notes:</strong> Awesome groove with standout Shon that gets a bit evil at times. Awkward first step into Broken Wing, but smooths out for the transition. 
" data-url="/jam-chart/?filter=Ginger Stardust">Ginger Stardust</span> (14) -> <span class="jam-entry jam-tooltip jam-link" data-tooltip="<strong>Timing:</strong> 12:46<br><strong>Notes:</strong> Short, but doesn&#x27;t feel like it. A tiny bit atmospheric to start the jam and a strong, blues-y Southern Rock second half.
