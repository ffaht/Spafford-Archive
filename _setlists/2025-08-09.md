<p class="show-notes"><em>This was the 27th show of the 2025 Summer Tour and the final show of the leg. This was a one set show part of the JamPacked Craft Beer & Music Festival. <strong>Darkness Singularity</strong> featured Tim Palmieri (Lotus) on guitar and contained Drinking Out of Cups (Dan Deacon) samples.</em></p>
<p class="review-text">Another surprisingly good festival set with some solid jams and tight playing throughout. They only had an hour, but still managed to squeeze in the first (and last?) Fake the Fate of the Summer, which had a cool P-Funk vibe to it, plus Darkness Singularity, which featured Tim Palmieri on guitar, some nifty electro, and a bit of cat-and-mouse that morphed smoothly, and Money for Nothing which touched on some cool drum and bass for a good few minutes. Kind of kicking myself for not driving three hours to see an hour of this.</p>
