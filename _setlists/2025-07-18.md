<p class="review-text">Spafford tearing it up in Charlotte as usual, especially with some incredible improvisation early. The first half of this Broken Wing features some of the most beautiful, serene jamming this year. It's just so free flowing and exploratory - tons of new sounds. Cory has been on fire with these patches lately. The second half grooves steadily with some Funkadelic teases, and then they float out into a cosmic sea. Top tier stuff. Goes down as the first ever Broken Wing -> Postman and the first Legend first set closer since 4/6/22 (Chelsea's Live, Baton Rogue, LA), ending a 325 show gap.</p>
<p class="review-text">Spafford tearing it up in Charlotte as usual with some setlist trickery (the first ever Broken Wing -> Postman and the first Legend first set closer since 4/6/22 (Baton Rogue, LA), ending a 325 show gap) and absolutely fire playing. Starting with a Broken Wing that's serene, free flowing, and exploratory in its first half and filled with Funkadelic teases in its second half, I knew I was in for a treat. The Postman getting warm and practically dancing down the Soul Train Line made for a fantastic first 51(!) minutes, and then they put the cherry on top with the Legend closer.</p>
