<p class="review-text">This was the 15th show  of the 2025 Summer Tour and the band's first appearance in Roswell. Tyler Neal Band was the opening act. This show featured the first Aliens since 12/31/19 (Great American Music Hall, San Francisco, CA), ending a 408 show gap. During Mind's Unchained, half the stage lost power. Comfortable contained an xxx tease. Special thanks to Z-Man for taping and Chuck for the [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZqXHDCe-3Q)!</p>
<p class="review-text">Lots of highlights here, especially with Comfortable > Aliens (ATLiens?) getting into deep, sample-ridden outer space early(!), Red's Jam bobbing and weaving with pace while toying with some nu jazz, and Anyone latching onto a very fun groove that Cory dazzles over. These guys are just so fucking good lately, another example of Spafford being on fire. DO NOT SLEEP on the setbreak jam in the link above! Insane shit!</p>
<p class="review-text">Weird side note - I usually couldn't care less for shows where Nick is in the back or about Enjoy the Silence, but I listened to the AUD and really liked it! I also went back through 10/4/24 in preparation of the next show, and it's amazing how much they've improved in such a short time. They sound like a different band.</p>
