<p class="review-text">This was the 30th show of the 2025 Summer Tour and the band's first appearance in Charlton. This was a one set show. Ain't That Wrong contained a My Name is McLovin sample and a xxx tease from Cory.</p>
<p class="review-text">They've been putting a little extra juice on the one-set shows lately, and this one's no exception. A few tunes were slower than usual (though mostly tight in the end), but there's plenty of good stuff here, especially with Darkness Singularity and a few other jams taking different, more exploratory routes than usual. Standouts here are Ain't That Wrong and Neutrino, both showing off entrancing, illustrative funk and electro-disco</p>
