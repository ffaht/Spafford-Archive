<p class="show-notes"><em>This was the third show of the 2025 Summer Tour and the band's fourth appearance in Fairfield. Darkness Singularity contained an Electric Taco Stand tease from Brian. <strong>Plush</strong> contained Old Enough to Party (Superbad) samples from Cory. <strong>Cantaloupe Island</strong> was performed in a House style.</em></p>
<p class="review-text">One of those shows where it just was not connecting with me as much as I thought it would. Still a pretty damn strong setlist on paper with good playing featured throughout (Cory has been crushing Night After Night lately and really steps up for Salamander Song). Definitely took a few listens to get into this one, though.</p>
<p class="review-text">Fun. (9/17)</p>
<p class="review-text">Highlights here are Plush, with its last 8 or so minutes dipping into a Fleetwood Mac-Pat Metheny blend, Dirtbath, which glides through shimmering space and plunges into a gooey, mechanical trance before closing, and Ain't That Wrong, which shows off your usual up-tempo, dancey jamming.</p>
<p class="review-text">---</p>
<p class="review-text">MVP:  Cory? Hard to say</p>
<p class="review-text">Highlights:  Night After Night, Shelter in Place > Salamander Song, Plush -> Dirtbath. Ain't That Wrong</p>
<p class="review-text">Heavy Rotation:  Plush</p>
