<p class="show-notes"><em>This was the 26th show of the 2025 Summer Tour and the band's first appearance in New River Gorge. This was a one set show. <strong>Plush</strong> contained full-band <strong>Electric Taco Stand</strong> teases. <strong>Electric Taco Stand</strong> contained a My Name is McLovin (McLovin) sample from Cory. Special thanks to Chuck for the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4gtN5M3PPQ|livestream]]!</em></p>
<p class="review-text">A surprisingly good set (festival appearance aside), with Ain't That Wrong and Plush growing legs, plus an ETS sandwich that Brian demolishes. Not much filler here, though I'd have preferred High Beams getting stretched out for a few more minutes (begging) instead of the out of place Kiss Off. Still, hard to complain given how much time they had.</p>

<p class="review-text">MVP:  Brian, but Shon was great</p>
<p class="review-text">Highlights:  Ain't That Wrong, Plush -> Electric Taco Stand, Weasel</p>
