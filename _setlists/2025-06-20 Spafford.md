<p class="show-notes"><em>This was the fifth show of the 2025 Summer Tour and the band's first appearance in King of Prussia. Jimkata was the opening act. This was a one set show. Special thanks to Chris Imburgia for taping. <strong>Neutrino</strong> contained a Drinking Out of Cups (Dan Deacon) sample from Cory. <strong>Ain't That Wrong</strong> contained El Pito (Joe Cuba) and <strong>Neutrino</strong> teases from Cory.</em></p>
<p class="show-notes"><em>"We've only got so much time. We don't even know how to play a five minute song."</em></p>
<p class="review-text">This Neutrino -> Swingtown combination is insane for so early in the show. Neutrino quickly makes its way into some deep House, builds with intent, and then hops its way into Swingtown, where they tap into some bumping Electro House at 13:54 and raise the energy to hit a blistering ending that drops straight into Ain't That Wrong. This is Yuma Tent. Holy shit! I was thinking it'd be Night After Night or Darkness Singularity! Wow! Moments like that are prime examples of how Spafford is on fire. The back half is a bit lackluster, . Definitely still some highlights here - don't sleep on the "first set" Neutrino -> Swingtown > Ain't That Wrong.</p>
