<p class="review-text">This was the 18th show of the 2025 Summer Tour and the band's first appearance in Iowa since 9/13/23 (Gabe's, Iowa City) ending a 180 show gap. This show featured the debut of Phoenix (Big Red Machine). The previous show, 7/29/25 (Ravinia Festival, Highland Park, IL) was not recorded due to the venue charging the band a fee for recording. Gotta Save Fred contained an xxx tease from Cory.</p>
<p class="show-notes"><em>"Davenport on a Wednesday. Who would've thought?"</em></p>
<p class="review-text">Really strong on paper, quite nice on the listen. More of a "let's try it out" type of show than anything else, especially with a debut (Phoenix) and scoping out softer territory than usual. Gold Glittered Hat would've fit well in this show, and I was honestly expecting it throughout the first set. Instant picks here are Neutrino (which feels like it's the best outing with each new appearance) and Gotta Save Fred. Another show where it's clear that Cory is propelling Spafford to another level with his new songs and the patches and textures he's designing.</p>
