<h3 class="setlist-header"><strong>Set 1:</strong>  Fuel (5), <strong class="highlighted-jam jam-tooltip jam-link" data-tooltip="<strong>Timing:</strong> 19:26<br><strong>Notes:</strong> A late-night, mid-century modern drive with a nice groove to it that swells with electric nervousness and descends into smoother space to &gt; In the Eyes of Thieves. Fantastic." data-url="/jam-chart/?filter=Shelter in Place">Shelter in Place</strong> (19) -> <span class="jam-entry jam-tooltip jam-link" data-tooltip="<strong>Timing:</strong> 21:20<br><strong>Notes:</strong> Locks in on a consonant groove that Cory works his magic over for the first half before Brian unleashes for the second half. Some really good Shon here.

<h3 class="setlist-header"><strong>Set 2:</strong>  <span class="jam-entry jam-tooltip jam-link" data-tooltip="<strong>Timing:</strong> 17:33<br><strong>Notes:</strong> Has an easygoing, Summer-time groove. The shortest version of the year (?)

<p class="show-notes"><em>This was the 24th show of the 2025 Summer Tour and the band's first appearance in Holland. Uncle Rhombus was the opening act. Special thanks to Chuck for the livestream!</em></p>
<p class="review-text">A much more swing-y start to Shelter in Place than usual and a much heavier start to the jam than usual.</p>
<p class="review-text">Beautifully spacious and concentrated jamming with this first set, with some deep improvisation in the 40 minute Shelter in Place -> In the Eyes of Thieves combo that each member - especially Brian and Shon - unleashes for. Smooth, Relax, Down directly afterwards was perfect, and the ethereal, jammed out Dissociation Assist to close was the cherry on top. I'm absolutely loving what these guys are doing lately.</p>
