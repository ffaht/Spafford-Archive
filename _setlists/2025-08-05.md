<p class="show-notes"><em>This was the 23rd show of the 2025 Summer Tour and the band's first appearance in Indianapolis since 10/14/21 (The Vogue), ending a <strong>360 show gap</strong>. This was a one set show. XXXX was the opening act.</em></p>
<p class="review-text">Wasn't too excited seeing that this was a one set show with five of the eight songs being played earlier in the week, but they've been on an absolute tear this year...and they played Legend, so I guess they get a pass for this one. Probably a better experience in person, though.</p>
<p class="review-text">While some of the shorter jams just don't do much for me, there are some incredible jams here. Gotta Save Fred moves through several different spaces, gets surprisingly bright, and has some fantastic jamming - already a JOTY nominee - and Enjoy the Silence has a really cool, 'late night in Ibiza' feel to it.</p>
