<p class="show-notes"><em>This was the first show of the 2025 Summer Tour and the band's first appearance in Allentown. <strong>Gold Glittered Hat</strong> contained an <strong>All My Friends</strong> tease from Brian. <strong>Broken Wing</strong> contained Norwegian Wood (The Beatles) teases from Cory and Drinking Out of Cups (Dan Deacon) samples from Cory and teases from Brian.</em></p>
<p class="review-text">Shred-central for the first set (aside from Gold Glittered Hat), which was probably great in person but leaves a bit to be desired on the tape. I will say that this Mind's Unchained is one of, if not the fieriest version ever.</p>
<p class="review-text">Waking up and seeing the second set looking like this can't be beat. This is the third Broken Wing in a row to break 30 minutes; it's becoming one of their go-to jam vehicles. The drop into gooey, pristine space at the 11 minute that had me feeling like I was in the Minecraft Movie, the push uphill for a sprawling peak at the 25 minute mark, and the final 10 minutes of deep, dancey space make for another great version. Fred instantly takes off into a bustling, future funk infused skyline and weaves through a jazzy business district before reaching a luminous surf. One of those transitions that come out of nowhere into the closing Frog Gossip. A tale of two sets, but definitely some stuff here that will be making end of the year lists.</p>
