<p class="show-notes"><em>This was the sixth show of the 2025 Summer Tour and the band's first appearance in Brattleboro. This show featured the first <strong>In the Eyes of Thieves</strong> opener since 6/11/23 (Press Room, Portsmouth, NH) ending a <strong>190 show gap</strong>. <strong>Hollywood</strong> contained Norwegian Wood teases from Brian and Cory and an "I have no intent to harm you" sample. <strong>High Beams</strong> contained xxxx samples from Cory. <strong>Dirtbath</strong> contained Around the World (Daft Punk) teases from Cory and Drinking Out of Cups (Dan Deacon) samples from Cory.</em></p>
<p class="review-text">Second set vibes all over this one, especially with the first two songs getting into some really colorful, concentrated space. There were a few moments where I thought that they might've gotten the tracklist mixed up, because some of these jams sound like they belong in the other set. Lots of highlights here, but the instant picks are Hollywood > High Beams > Dirtbath, particularly with Hollywood checking all the boxes with some very pretty sounds and some dance ?... , and High Beams with its most ambitious outing yet. It's crazy how good these new Cory songs have been.</p>
