<p class="show-notes"><em>This was the 32nd show of the 2025 Summer Tour and the band's first appearance in Maryland (and the band's first ever appearance in Elkton) since 6/19/24 (Baltimore Soundstage, Baltimore), ending a <strong>118 show gap</strong>. <strong>Pursuit of Madness</strong> contained an <strong>Ice Cream</strong> tease from Brian. <strong>Gold Glittered Hat</strong> contained a Free (Phish) tease from Cory.</em></p>
<p class="review-text">Intent with power from the start, this one gets underway with the first Pursuit of Madness opener in well over a year (3/22/24 Roanoke, VA -  135 show gap) that feels more like a second set closer than a show opener, with peaks galore. It's followed up by a talented Ice Cream, a fiery Back in L.A., and an entrancing Duncan's Uncle.</p>
<p class="review-text">Second set kept things going and was probably a great experience in person, with all four jams showing off signature Spafford grooves and some serious shredding from Brian, though a few tired moments popped up. Gotta give it to Shon for another rock-solid night. Highlight here is Duncan's Uncle, with an awesome first 15 minutes, and Galisteo Way deserves a mention for some very unusual midi-mutron work from Brian.</p>
