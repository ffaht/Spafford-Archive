(Truly inspired, up-tempo drum and bass. Easily one of the best versions this year.)

<p class="show-notes"><em>This was the 29th show of the 2025 Summer Tour and the band's first appearance in Essex Junction. <strong>The Remedy</strong> contained a <strong>Broken Wing</strong> tease from Shon. <strong>On Fire</strong> featured Rob Compa (Neighbor) on guitar and contained a My Name is McLovin sample from Cory.</em></p>
<p class="show-notes"><em>welcome to the future</em></p>
<p class="review-text">One of the most well rounded shows of the Summer, with sharp playing across the board and inspired jamming throughout. The Remedy gets into some nice space early, and Shelter in Place steps up with a consecutive highlight that moves through a few different rooms with loops floating overhead. Some killer Shon, for sure. They were locked in. High Beams has an unusually Afro-Funk solo from Cory, and The Postman has a nice groove to it and sharp synths. That's just the first set!</p>
<p class="review-text">Second set definitely kept the pace going: a speedy Double Time, an On Fire (feat. Rob Compa) that's metronomic to start and launches into a rocket-race between Brian and Rob, and a Dirtbath that breaks the 30-minute mark and focuses on stutter-step funk with a brief electro phase. The standout is Double Time (was so happy this went so far!!), which is basically a PlayStation 1 nostalgia ambient atmospheric jungle drum and bass mix. So fucking good!</p>
