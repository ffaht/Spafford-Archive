<p class="show-notes"><em>This was the sixth show of the 2025 Summer Tour and the band's first appearance in Brattleboro. This show featured the first <strong>In the Eyes of Thieves</strong> opener since 6/11/23 (Press Room, Portsmouth, NH) ending a <strong>190 show gap</strong>. <strong>Hollywood</strong> contained Norwegian Wood teases from Brian and Cory. <strong>Dirtbath</strong> contained Around the World (Daft Punk) teases from Cory and Drinking Out of Cups (Dan Deacon) samples from Cory.</em></p>
<p class="review-text">Second set vibes all over this one, especially with the first two songs getting into some really colorful, concentrated space. There were a few moments where I thought that they might've gotten the track list mixed up, because some of these jams sound like they belong in the other set. Lots of highlights here, but the instant picks are The Way You Do the Things You Do (highly recommended!) and Hollywood -> High Beams, which checks all the boxes with some very pretty sounds, dancey vibes, and ambitious playing.</p>
