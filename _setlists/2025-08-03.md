<p class="review-text">This was the 22nd show of the 2025 Summer Tour and the band's first appearance at Magic Stick since 10/15/21, ending a 359 show gap. This show featured the first Comfortable opener since 2/25/24 (Old Town Pub, Steamboat Springs, CO) ending a 144 show gap. Dirtbath contained an My Name is McLovin (McLovin) sample from Cory. Special thanks to Chuck for the livestream!</p>
<p class="show-notes"><em></em></p>
<p class="review-text">One of those nights where everything was clicking, and you can tell from the setlist alone. Starting out with a jam-packed first set that features three unique jams that I just can't seem to put down - Comfortable cycling steadily, War of Man sounding like a PS2 racing game, and Dirtbath getting and staying funky throughout.</p>
<p class="review-text">Second set is its own beast. Neutrino smashes the 30 minute mark and moves through three different spaces with some very nice improv in certain spots, and the ETS sandwich features some fantastic work from Brian, especially during Alternate Ending and the closing peaks of the set.</p>
<p class="review-text">So, so much good stuff here.</p>
